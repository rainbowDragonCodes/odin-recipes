    <h1>Milkshake Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/milkshake.jpg" alt="Milkshake">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for my favorite sugar-free mocha milkshake recipe.
        The recipe uses actual coffee, so make sure to use a caffeine-free 
        alternative if serving it for children or people who don't drink 
        caffeinated drinks. The recipre is also sugar-free and uses sugar 
        alternatives instead, so make sure that the people that you're 
        serving it to are not allergic or sensitive to those ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>I like to use real coffe in my mocha milkshare because I first came
        up with the recipe while wanting to drink a milkshake, but also 
        needing caffeine desparately. I've had mocha milkshakes before
        this of course, but they were usually only coffee flavored, not
        actually caffeinated.
    </p>
    <p>There are many different options for sugar substitutes these days.
        My favorite ones to use are allulose and stevia. I usually use 
        allulose for recipes where I need the sugar substitute to melt, 
        but since that is not neccessary for this recipe, I usually just
        use stevia.
