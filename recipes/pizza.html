    <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best pizza recipe that I've ever used. The most important 
        parts of the recipe that make it so good are the kind of flour used 
        and the temperature. It's also useful to measure your ingredients 
        by weight instead of volume. This is important because powdered 
        ingredients like flour or salt can condense under their own weight
        and this can affect measurements based on volume.
    </p>
    <p>The flour used in this recipe is a 00 flour. This is a very fine kind
        of white flour. Using this kind of flour instead of an all-purpose 
        flour is what makes the texture of the dough perfect. This kind of
        flour used to be hard to find, but these days you can find it in 
        pretty much any grocery store you'll go to. 
    </p>
    <p>Very high tempretures are extremely important for making the perfect
        pizza. The easiest way of achieving the right temperature without a 
        pizza oven is by using your grill. Grills can get up to a much higher
        tempreature than most ovens that people have in their homes.
