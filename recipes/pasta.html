    <h1>Pasta Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/pasta.jpg" alt="Pasta">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for the feta and tomato pasta that got popular 
        recently after it went viral on TikTok. While many people 
        immediately criticized it for not being authentic italian 
        cuisine, but I think that these people are misunderstanding
        why the recipe went viral. The biggest draw of this recipe
        is how quick and easy it is.
    </p>
    <p>The active part of this recipe doesn't take more than five 
        minutes and even some of that can be omittid if you don't
        use fresh garlic. The recipe is also very costumizable if 
        someone does want to make it more impressive.
    </p>
    <p>One important tip that I have for leftovers is to store the
        pasta and the sauce separetely instead of combinig them. 
        If you warm up the pasta and the sauce separetely the next
        day instead of just microvawing them together, it will be
        less likely to dry out and more likely to taste just as good
        as it did on the first day. 
    </p>
